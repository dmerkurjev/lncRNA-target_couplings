a high-throughput parallel CRISPRi screening platform that combines live-cell imaging with a scalable RNA-seq workflow to generate unbiased analyses of lncRNA regulation. For each lncRNA target of interest, a pool of up to 10 single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) was produced by high-throughput in vitro transcription of sgRNA templates generated by multiplex PCR. The resulting sgRNA pools were delivered by electroporation to HEK293T cells with stable dCAS9-KRAB expression.
