LncRNA Analysis — Preprocessing & Analysis

This repository contains an end-to-end workflow for RNA-seq analysis of lncRNAs results in tight lncRNA–target couplings.
This is an analysis of a high-throughput parallel CRISPRi screening platform that combines live-cell imaging with a scalable
RNA-seq workflow to generate unbiased analyses of lncRNA regulation. For each lncRNA target of interest, a pool of up to 10 
single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) was produced by high-throughput in vitro transcription of sgRNA templates generated by multiplex 
PCR. The resulting sgRNA pools were delivered by electroporation to HEK293T cells with stable dCAS9-KRAB expression. 

It includes two main components: 

Preprocessing (Clean.sh)
Downloads SRA runs, builds 4 sample FASTQs, performs QC, alignment, and outputs gene transcription level.

Analysis (Differential_expression.sh)
Performs differential expression analysis using edgeR.

Data

SRA BioProject: PRJNA610861 
BJ fibroblasts transduced with doxycycline inducible empty vector control retroviruses were grown in the absence
or continued presence of doxycycline (20nm), and young-quiescent or senescent cells were collected for RNA-seq. 
Senescent and young doxycycline treated samples were compared for changes in genes expression, and senescent and 
young doxycycline untreated samples were compared separately.
